# Mysfits
AWS Python Workshop
I will implement Mythical Mysfits using these modules:

Create Static Website Build a static website, using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that serves static content (images, static text, etc.) for My website.

Build Dynamic Website Host My application logic on a web server, using an API backend microservice deployed as a container through AWS Fargate.

Store Mysfit Data Externalize all of the mysfit data and persist it with a managed NoSQL database provided by Amazon DynamoDB.

Add User Registration Enable users to registration, authentication, and authorization so that Mythical Mysfits visitors can like and adopt myfits, enabled through AWS API Gateway and its integration with Amazon Cognito.

Capture User Clicks Capture user behavior with a clickstream analysis microservice that will record and analyze clicks on the website using AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis Firehose.

I will be creating and deploying changes to this application completely programmatically. I will use the AWS Command Line Interface to execute commands that create the required infrastructure components, which includes a fully managed CI/CD stack utilizing AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline. Finally, I will complete the development tasks required all within My own browser using the cloud-based IDE, AWS Cloud9.
